noughts and crosses

Basis of game:

    Two players
    Each player assigned playing symbol (x and o)
    One player plays  at a time
    Player place’s their symbol on the grid
    Symbol cannot be placed over another symbol
    
Objective of game:

    Get three matching symbols in either a vertical, horizontal or diagonal placement to win the game
    
Issues of play:

    A tie; where all boxes contain symbols but there are no matching three’s 9 (no winner)


How it can work technically:

    I need to create 9 clickable boxes the need to be able to deal with the following;
                  
                    Accepting and containing a symbol via a click event
                    Not allow other symbol to overwrite containing symbol
                    Able to talk to surrounding boxes to calculate a win

    I need a random play event (ie, playing against the computer) generator to work along side the user driven events

    I need to be able to keep the score (ie, if the user wants to play best of 5)

    I need to be able to override the computer play generator so two humans can play each other

9 boxes
once box is ‘checked’ it is fixed with that object
computer randomly adds it own ‘play’

once three are in a row a win is declared

have 9 div’s as the objects hidden in the background
